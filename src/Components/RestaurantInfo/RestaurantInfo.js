              We showcase sustainable food mostly sourced from the American
              Isles with dishes that are designed to be shared. Red meat is
              served either classically or dressed with specific garnish to
              compliment the texture and flavours of the individual oysters.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also a selection of snacks, smaller and larger plates
              which always features a whole chargrilled fish and at least one
              meat dish.
            </p>
            <p>
              We source the freshest fish possible and respect the quality of
              ingredients by letting the produce sing. Desserts are a short line
              up of cheese and two sweet treats.
